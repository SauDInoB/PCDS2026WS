# Why Python? {background-color="#2C3E50"}

## What is Programming?

> Writing **instructions** that a computer can execute, step by step.

- A **program** is a recipe: precise, unambiguous, repeatable
- **Python** is a *language* — a way to write those instructions

. . .

*You don't need to be a mathematician. You need to be able to think logically.*

::: {.notes}
Analogy: a cooking recipe. If you tell a chef "add some salt", they use judgment. A computer cannot — you must be exact. That precision is what programming teaches.
:::

---

## Why Python?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Easy to read**
```python
# Find patients over 65
elderly = [p for p in patients
           if p.age > 65]
```
Almost reads like English.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Huge ecosystem**

- `pandas` — data tables
- `numpy` — numerical computing
- `scipy` — statistics
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` — plots
- `scikit-learn` — machine learning
- `streamlit` — web apps
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Show the code block — even a non-programmer can guess what it does. That readability lowers the barrier to entry enormously.
:::

---

## Python in Health Data Science

Real-world uses in medicine and research:

::: {.incremental}
- 🏥 **Clinical data analysis** — patient cohort studies, survival analysis
- 🧬 **Genomics & bioinformatics** — sequence analysis, variant calling
- 🩻 **Medical imaging** — DICOM processing, deep learning diagnostics
- 📊 **Public health** — epidemiological modelling (COVID-19 models were largely Python)
- 📝 **Reproducible research** — Quarto notebooks combining code + text
:::

::: {.notes}
If anyone is sceptical about whether Python is "serious" enough for medicine, mention that Nature, The Lancet, and NEJM have all published studies with Python-based analyses.
:::

---

## Programming Languages: The Landscape

| Language | Strengths | Role in health data |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 🐍 **Python** | General purpose, ML/AI, readable | Analysis, models, pipelines, apps |
| 📊 **R** | Statistics, visualisation | Clinical trials, bioinformatics |
| 🗃️ **SQL** | Querying databases | Electronic records, registries |
| ⚡ **Julia** | High-performance numerics | Simulations, pharmacokinetics |
| 🔧 **Bash** | Automation, scripting | Data pipelines, batch processing |

::: {.callout-tip}
They complement each other. Many real workflows combine **SQL** to extract, **Python** to analyse, and **R** for statistical reporting.
:::

::: {.notes}
No need to learn them all. The goal today is Python. But understanding the landscape helps you choose the right tool — and understand why Python is increasingly the default for data science in health.
:::

# Installing Python {background-color="#2C3E50"}

## The Terminal — Your New Best Friend

The **terminal** (Command Prompt / PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS) lets you talk to your computer with text commands.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Open it:**

- **Windows** → search "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
- **macOS** → search "Terminal" (or use Spotlight: `⌘ Space`)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Essential commands:**

```bash
# Where am I?
pwd

# List files here
ls        # macOS
dir       # Windows

# Move into a folder
cd my_project
```
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Spend 2 minutes on this. Open it live. Type `pwd` and `ls`. The goal is just to demystify it — many beginners are afraid of the terminal. Reassure them: you can't break anything by typing wrong commands (within reason).
:::

---

## Python Versions

- Current stable release: **Python 3.x** (use 3.11 or 3.12)
- **Python 2 is dead** — don't install it
- Version numbers: `3.12.2` → major `.` minor `.` patch

. . .

```bash
# Check if Python is already installed
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

::: {.notes}
Someone in the room may already have Python installed (e.g. via Anaconda). It's worth checking before installing again.
:::

---

## Installing Python — Windows

1. Go to **[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)**
2. Download the latest **Python 3.x** installer
3. Run the installer — **check "Add Python to PATH"** ✅
4. Verify in **Command Prompt**:

```bash
python --version
```

::: {.callout-warning}
Always tick "Add Python to PATH" during installation, or nothing will work from the terminal.
:::

::: {.notes}
Live demo here. Walk slowly through the installer. The PATH checkbox is the single most common mistake beginners make.
:::

---

## Installing Python — macOS

**Option A — Direct (recommended for beginners):**

1. Go to **[python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)**
2. Download the macOS installer (`.pkg`)
3. Run and follow prompts
4. Verify in **Terminal**: `python3 --version`

. . .

**Option B — Homebrew** *(package manager, more powerful)*:

```bash
# Install Homebrew first (from brew.sh)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Python
brew install python
```

::: {.notes}
Homebrew is worth mentioning for Mac users who want to manage multiple tools. Don't spend too long on it — for today's session the direct installer is perfectly fine.
:::

---

## A Word on Anaconda

You'll often see **Anaconda** (or **Miniconda**) mentioned in tutorials — it's an alternative Python distribution bundled with data science packages and its own package manager (`conda`).

. . .

| | Python.org | Anaconda |
|--|--|--|
| Install size | Small | Large (~3 GB) |
| Package manager | `pip` | `conda` + `pip` |
| Popular in | General / web | Academia / data science |

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
We use plain Python + `pip` this week. If a colleague sends you a `conda` command, it works the same way — just swap `pip install` → `conda install`.
:::

::: {.notes}
Don't install Anaconda today. Just mention it so students don't panic when they see it elsewhere. The key message: it's not magic, just a different way to get Python and packages.
:::

---

## What is `pip`?

`pip` = **Python's package installer**

```bash
# Install a package
pip install pandas

# Install a specific version
pip install pandas==2.2.0

# List installed packages
pip list
```

. . .

Think of it like an **app store for Python libraries**.

::: {.notes}
They won't use pip directly today, but they'll see it used throughout the week. Just plant the concept.
:::

---

## What is a Virtual Environment?

A **virtual environment** isolates packages per project — no conflicts between projects.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install packages inside it
pip install pandas numpy
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Positron (our IDE) manages virtual environments for you automatically.
:::

::: {.notes}
Don't dive deep here — just mention it exists. Positron makes this transparent. Come back to it if asked.
:::

# What is an IDE? {background-color="#2C3E50"}

## Text Editor vs IDE

| | Text Editor | IDE |
|--|-------------|-----|
| Edit code | ✅ | ✅ |
| Syntax highlighting | ✅ | ✅ |
| Autocomplete | ❌ / basic | ✅ |
| Run code inline | ❌ | ✅ |
| Variable explorer | ❌ | ✅ |
| Debug tools | ❌ | ✅ |
| Git integration | ❌ | ✅ |

*Examples: Notepad, nano = editors · VS Code, Positron, PyCharm = IDEs*

::: {.notes}
You *can* write Python in Notepad. You can also cook on a camping stove. But for daily work, you want a proper kitchen.
:::

---

## VS Code — Quick Overview

**Visual Studio Code** (by Microsoft) is the world's most popular code editor.

- Free, open source, cross-platform
- Huge extension marketplace
- Works for Python, R, JavaScript, …
- **Not** specialised for data science

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
We mention VS Code because you'll see it everywhere online. But for *data science*, we'll use **Positron**.
:::

::: {.notes}
Show VS Code briefly if you have it open. Point out the sidebar, terminal, and extension panel. Then pivot to Positron.
:::

---

## Positron — The Data Science IDE

**Positron** is a new IDE built by **Posit** (creators of RStudio), forked from VS Code.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
**Why Positron for data science?**

- Built-in **variable explorer**
- Interactive **data viewer** (like a spreadsheet)
- **Plots panel** — no pop-up windows
- First-class **Quarto** support
- Works with **Python and R**
- AI assistant (**Positron Data Assistant**)
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
![Positron interface](https://positron.posit.co/images/positron-screenshot.png)
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
This is the main sell. If students have used RStudio, Positron will feel immediately familiar. If not, highlight the data viewer — seeing a table without writing `print(df)` is a game changer for beginners.
:::

---

## Installing Positron

1. Go to **[positron.posit.co](https://positron.posit.co)**
2. Download for your OS (Windows / macOS)
3. Install and open
4. Positron will detect your Python installation automatically

. . .

**First steps in Positron:**

- Open a folder as your project
- Create a new `.py` file
- Run your first line: `print("Hello, health data!")`
- Observe the **Console**, **Variables**, and **Plots** panels

::: {.notes}
Live demo. Create a new folder, open it in Positron, create a .py file, type a few lines and run them. Show the variable explorer populating as you assign variables.
:::

---

## Positron — Interface Tour

| | **Left** | **Right** |
|---|---|---|
| **Top** | 📁 Explorer (files) | ✏️ Editor — your `.py` files |
| **Bottom** | ⌨️ Console (output) | 📊 Variables · 📈 Plots / Viewer |

::: {.notes}
Point to each panel while running code live. Assign a variable in the editor, run it, show it appear in Variables. Load a CSV and show it in the Viewer.
:::

---

## Your First Python Lines

Open Positron → new file → type these → press **Run**:

```python
# A greeting
print("Hello, health data!")

# Variables
patient_age = 34
bmi = 22.5
is_diabetic = False

# A simple calculation
height_m = 1.72
weight_kg = 74
bmi = weight_kg / height_m ** 2
print(f"BMI: {bmi:.1f}")
```

. . .

Watch the **Variables panel** fill up as each line runs. ✨

::: {.notes}
This is the payoff moment for the whole installation section. Keep it light and fun. If someone has an error, use it as a teaching moment — reading error messages is a key skill.
:::

---

## ☕ Break — 10 minutes {background-color="#2C3E50"}

*Back at [time + 10 min]*

::: {.notes}
Good moment to help anyone still stuck on installation before moving to Git.
:::

# Git & GitHub {background-color="#2C3E50"}

## Why Version Control?

> "Which file is the final version?"

. . .

```
analysis_final.py
analysis_final_v2.py
analysis_final_FINAL.py
analysis_final_FINAL_use_this_one.py  ← 😅
```

. . .

**Version control solves this:**

- Every change is tracked with a message
- You can go back to any point in history
- Multiple people can work on the same project
- Nothing is ever truly lost

::: {.notes}
Every researcher recognises the "final_FINAL" problem. This is the emotional hook — version control is the professional solution.
:::

---

## GitHub.com

**GitHub** is a cloud platform for hosting Git repositories.

::: {.incremental}
- **Public repos** — open source, visible to everyone
- **Private repos** — only you (and collaborators) can see them
- Great for **sharing analysis code** with collaborators or reviewers
- Journals increasingly require code availability → GitHub is the standard
:::

. . .

→ Create a free account at **[github.com](https://github.com)**

::: {.notes}
Mention that GitHub is owned by Microsoft. For health data: never put patient data in a GitHub repo — only code. Data stays local or in a secure server.
:::

---

## GitHub Desktop

**GitHub Desktop** makes Git visual — no command line needed.

**Install:** [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)

. . .

**Basic workflow:**

1. **Create** a new repository (or Clone an existing one)
2. Edit files in your project
3. GitHub Desktop shows **what changed**
4. Write a short commit message → **Commit to main**
5. **Push** to sync with GitHub.com

::: {.notes}
Live demo: create a new repo in GitHub Desktop, create a Python file in Positron, go back to GitHub Desktop, show the diff, write a commit message, commit, push. Open github.com to show it live online.
:::

---

## Git Workflow — In Practice

```
Your Computer                     GitHub.com
─────────────────                 ─────────────────

 [Edit files]
      │
      ▼
 [git commit]  ──── push ──────►  [Remote repo]
      │                                  │
      ◄──────────── pull ────────────────┘
```

*With GitHub Desktop: all of this is point-and-click.*

::: {.notes}
Reinforce the mental model. "Commit" saves locally, "push" sends to the cloud, "pull" brings cloud changes back to you.
:::

# Best Practices {background-color="#2C3E50"}

## Why Best Practices Matter

Code is read **many more times** than it is written.

. . .

*"Always write code as if the person who will maintain it is a violent psychopath who knows where you live."*
— Martin Golding

. . .

More practically: **future you** will thank present you.

::: {.notes}
Lighten the mood with the quote, then bring it back to reality. In health research, code may need to be audited, reproduced, or handed over to colleagues.
:::

---

## PEP 8 — Python's Style Guide

**PEP 8** is the official Python style guide. Key rules:

```python
# ✅ Good
patient_age = 65
MAX_RETRIES = 3

def calculate_bmi(weight_kg, height_m):
    return weight_kg / height_m ** 2

# ❌ Avoid
PatientAge = 65        # CamelCase for variables
x = 65                 # cryptic names
def calc(w,h): return w/h**2  # no spaces, unclear
```

::: {.notes}
The point isn't memorising PEP 8 — Positron and VS Code flag violations automatically. The point is awareness.
:::

---

## Naming Conventions

| What | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Variables & functions | `snake_case` | `patient_id`, `load_data()` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_AGE = 120` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` | `PatientRecord` |
| Private (internal) | `_leading_underscore` | `_raw_data` |

. . .

**Rule of thumb:** names should explain *what* something is, not *how* it's stored.

```python
# ❌ df2      → what is this?
# ✅ filtered_patients  → clear!
```

---

## Comments & Docstrings

```python
# Single-line comment: explain the WHY, not the WHAT

# ❌ Bad: obvious comment
x = x + 1  # add 1 to x

# ✅ Good: explains intent
age += 1  # adjust for 0-indexed age groups in the dataset

def normalise_score(score, max_score):
    """
    Normalise a raw score to a 0–1 scale.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score : float
        Raw score value.
    max_score : float
        Maximum possible score.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Normalised score between 0 and 1.
    """
    return score / max_score
```

::: {.notes}
Docstrings are picked up by Positron's hover documentation and by tools like Sphinx for auto-generating docs. Encourage writing them from day one.
:::

## Project Folder Structure

```
my_project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/          ← original files, never modified
│   └── processed/    ← cleaned versions
├── notebooks/        ← exploratory .ipynb or .qmd files
├── scripts/          ← reusable .py functions
├── outputs/
│   ├── figures/
│   └── tables/
├── README.md         ← what is this project?
└── requirements.txt  ← which packages are needed
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Keep `raw/` data read-only. Always work on copies in `processed/`.
:::

::: {.notes}
This structure scales from a small homework project to a full research pipeline. The README and requirements.txt are what make a repo usable by others (or by you in 6 months).

# What's Coming Next {background-color="#2C3E50"}

## Session 2 — This Afternoon (16h15)

**Variables, Data Types & Functions** · Led by Abel

::: {.incremental}
- Variable types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Data structures: `list`, `dict`, `tuple`
- Writing your own functions
- Introduction to `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`
:::

. . .

**Make sure you have:**
- ✅ Python installed
- ✅ Positron installed
- ✅ GitHub Desktop installed + account created

::: {.notes}
This is the "exit ticket" — check that everyone has the tools ready before they leave. If someone is stuck on installation, this is the moment to help or arrange help during the break.
